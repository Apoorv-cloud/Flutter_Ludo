## ‚≠ê How to get started?

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/not-a-bug-a-feature.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) <br>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Flutter_Ludo](https://github.com/Apoorv-cloud/Flutter_Ludo) by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button.

<br>


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Flutter_Ludo.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `Flutter_Ludo` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Flutter_Ludo
$ cd Flutter_Ludo
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Flutter_Ludo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Flutter_Ludo.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [Flutter_Ludo](https://github.com/Apoorv-cloud/Flutter_Ludo) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Apoorv-cloud/Flutter_Ludo
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Flutter_Ludo.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Flutter_Ludo.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/shagun25/Flutter_Ludo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/shagun25/Flutter_Ludo.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Flutter_Ludo` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start building this project.
